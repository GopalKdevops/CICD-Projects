Steps:
1. Install the necessary Jenkins plugins:
   1.1 Git plugin
   1.2 Maven Integration plugin
   1.3 Pipeline plugin
   1.4 Kubernetes Continuous Deploy plugin

2. Create a new Jenkins pipeline:
   2.1 In Jenkins, create a new pipeline job and configure it with the Git repository URL for the Java application.
   2.2 Add a Jenkins file to the Git repository to define the pipeline stages.

3. Define the pipeline stages:
Stage 1: Checkout: Placeholder, fetches code from the repository.
Stage 2: Build and Test: Builds the project and packages it.
Stage 3: Static Code Analysis: Runs static code analysis via SonarQube.
Stage 4: Build and Push Docker Image: Builds a Docker image and pushes it to a registry.
Stage 5: Update Deployment File: Updates the Kubernetes deployment manifest with the new Docker image version and pushes it back to Git.    

4. Configure Jenkins pipeline stages:
    Stage 1: Use the Git plugin to check out the source code from the Git repository.
    Stage 2: Use the Maven Integration plugin to build the Java application.
    Stage 3: Use the SonarQube plugin to analyze the code quality of the Java application.
    Stage 4. Build a Docker image for the application and push it to a Docker registry.
    Stage 5: Update the Kubernetes deployment manifest file to use the new Docker image version

5. Set up Argo CD:
    Install Argo CD on the Kubernetes cluster.
    Set up a Git repository for Argo CD to track the changes in the Kubernetes manifests.

6. Configure Jenkins pipeline to integrate with Argo CD:
   6.1 Add the Argo CD API token to Jenkins credentials.
   6.2 Update the Jenkins pipeline to include the Argo CD deployment stage.

7. Run the Jenkins pipeline:
   7.1 Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to start the CI/CD process for the Java application.
   7.2 Monitor the pipeline stages and fix any issues that arise.

This end-to-end Jenkins pipeline will automate the entire CI/CD process for a Java application, from code checkout to production deployment, using popular tools like SonarQube, Argo CD, Helm, and Kubernetes.
